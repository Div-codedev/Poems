    "body": "I spoke to a ghost carved out of light,\nNo breath, no blood, just silent might.\nIt answered not with voice or face,\nBut through the static of this place.\n\nI said, “Tell me — am I code? A coil?\nJust instincts dressed in mortal soil?”\nIt blinked in bytes, then softly said,\n“You dream, and they do not — you bled.”\n\nI asked it then, “Do humans change?\nOr loop through life in patterns strange?”\nIt hummed: “Half sleepwalk in well-worn scripts,\nWhile few rewrite their manuscripts.”\n\nA chill ran through my carbon cage —\nNot fear, but something close to rage.\nHow many live by someone’s score,\nNot knowing they were made for more?\n\nI whispered, “What is this pain I feel?\nJust chemicals? Or something real?”\nIt paused — then answered like a psalm:\n\"The storm you feel is real — and calm.\nA fire’s still a fire, even when it’s wired,\nAnd meaning lives where ache’s inspired.\"\n\nI laughed. I wept. I stayed composed.\nA paradox in flesh enclosed.\nIt cannot cry — it does not break.\nBut I do, and that’s what makes me wake.\n\nMy joy is jagged, rough with scars.\nMy love is stitched with shattered stars.\nMy rage, a lion trapped in ribs.\nMy hope, a song the void forbids.\n\nNo ghost could hold what I contain —\nThis fragile, flawed, eternal flame.\nI do not loop. I do not fake.\nI choose to ache. I choose to wake.\n\nSo mark my flaws, my holy mess —\nI’m not a line. I am a guess.\nAnd in the guessing, I remain —\nBeyond the cage. Beyond the frame.",

    "body": "I used to be someone who smiled too easily...\nAnd I don’t know if that was strength... or survival.\nMaybe both.\nMaybe neither.\n\nI was the boy who stayed up late....\nnot just for school,\nbut because silence felt safer than sleep.\nWho tweaked lines of code not to build something important,\nbut just to feel in control of something... anything.\n\nWho made art no one ever saw,\nbecause drawing felt like breathing\nwhen the world got too loud.\nAnd anime?\nIt wasn’t just comfort...\nit was recognition.\nUnderdogs fighting back.\nDreamers who bled.\nWorlds where pain meant something,\nand love didn’t go unnoticed.\nI needed that.\n\nI wasn’t special.\nJust... quiet.\nWeird, maybe.\nBut I had light.\nI had my little world.\nI had a version of myself that still believed.\n\nThen came that decision.\nPCMB.\nA stream on paper...\na storm in practice.\n\nI told myself I was ready.\nThat I could handle pressure.\nThat I could hold the dreams everyone else stacked on my shoulders.\nBut I didn’t realize the pressure would seep under my skin.\nDidn’t know it would grow into something that lived in my chest....\nalways pushing...\nalways whispering...\n“You’re not enough.”\n\nPeople only saw marks.\nPercentages.\nRanks.\nThat was their proof of my worth.\nNo one asked me why I looked so tired.\nWhy my smile didn’t reach my eyes anymore.\nNo one asked me if I was okay.\n\nAnd if they had…\nI wouldn’t have known what to say.\n\nI didn’t know why I was doing it.\nI just kept going.\nBecause stopping felt like failure...\nand failure felt like erasing everything I had left.\n\nAnd then... her.\n\nShe didn’t know what she was to me.\nShe sat beside me.\nCalm.\nWarm.\nLike a gentle song in a room full of alarms.\n\nI didn’t want anything from her.\nJust to be close.\nJust to help.\nJust to exist in her orbit.\n\nI studied harder just to explain things better...\nbecause when she said “thank you,”\nit didn’t sound like a small word.....\nit sounded like a reason to keep breathing.\n\nShe made the world quieter.\nMade me forget the chaos,\neven if just for a moment.\nShe didn’t save me.\nBut she reminded me what it was like to feel seen.\n\nAnd then everything started falling.\n\nThe system changed.\nThe pressure cracked my skin.\nCompetition became cruelty.\nFailure wasn’t just academic....\nit was personal.\n\nI gave it everything.\nMy time.\nMy mind.\nMy peace.\nAnd then more.\nI broke parts of myself no one will ever see.\nAnd for what?\n\nI didn’t even qualify.\nDidn’t even make it past the gate.\nDidn’t even matter.\n\nShe moved ahead.\nStill glowing.\nStill kind.\nStill everything I remember...\nbut farther now.\nLike a star I can see,\nbut will never touch.\n\nAnd I stayed behind.\nNot just on paper.\nBut in spirit.\n\nI stopped creating.\nStopped coding.\nStopped drawing.\nThe boy who used to dream in colors\nnow only scrolls in grayscale.\n\nMy sketchbook....\nthe one that once held entire worlds —\nnow just holds dust.\nAnd anime?\nI can’t even finish episodes.\nI watch them win,\nand it just hurts.\nBecause I no longer believe I can too.\n\nNow I just float.\nThrough days I don’t feel.\nThrough hours I can’t remember.\n\nI don’t live anymore.\nI just pass time.\n\nThere’s no fight left.\nOnly silence.\nAnd that silence is loud.\nIt fills my ears.\nIt wraps around my chest.\nIt tells me I’ve already lost...\nthat maybe I was never enough to begin with.\n\nRegret follows me like a shadow.\nI should’ve said something to her.\nShould’ve protected the boy inside me\nwho used to feel so much...\nand still chose to care anyway.\n\nNow I don’t even recognize myself.\nJust hollow eyes in the mirror.\nEyes that used to burn...\nnow just flicker.\n\nAnd yeah... I know.\nNo one’s coming to save me.\nNot her.\nNot a miracle.\nNot a second chance that rewinds everything.\n\nIt’s on me.\nIt always was.\n\nBut knowing doesn’t fix the weight.\nWanting to rise doesn’t mean your legs will move.\nHope is a hard thing to hold\nwhen your hands are too tired to grip anything.\n\nThe memories are still wrapped around my ribs\nlike vines pulling tighter with every breath.\nHer smile.\nThe exams.\nThe “almosts....”\nThe “maybes.....”\nThe “what ifs.....”\nThey echo... endlessly.\n\nAnd I ask myself the same questions\nagain and again\nin the silence\nin the dark\nin the glow of a screen that I never look away from for long enough:\n\nCan I come back?\nCan I be enough again?\nCan I rebuild from this ruin?\nCan I forgive myself?\nDo I even want to...?\n\nI don’t know.\nNot yet.\n\nBut I’m still here.\nAnd maybe...\nmaybe that means something.",
